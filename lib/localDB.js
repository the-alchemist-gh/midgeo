    title: 'MEDICINE MAN',
    synopsis:
      'Dr. Ben Muriithi (Pish Kago) is a Medical Doctor, who has been working in a State Hospital in Nairobi.  He comes from a long Line of Traditional Healers.  His great-great grandfather, his great grandfather, his grandfather and his father were all well-known and respected Community Healers in Embu.\r\n\r\nSo, he has a deep interest in Herbal & Alternative Medicine, but also decided to go to Medical School to learn modern Medicine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in his absence, his cousin - Gicovi Njoka (Sam Ukavi), was given the Mantle to continue Treating the Community, in place of Muriithi - who is the true direct Descendant of Healers.  Gicovi also decides to dabble in Witchcraft, due to Greed and the Desire of material Wealth and Power in present-day Kenya. \r\n\r\nMuriithi becomes aware of the Problems this creates in his Community, and cannot resist the Duty to help his People - he is, after all, a Healer at heart.  So, he returns home to set-up a Research Facility on the healing powers of Herbal Remedies, combined with his Knowledge of western Medical Science.  Muriithi believes that the two can work together, to prevent further Deaths of his people from treatable Diseases.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN is the Story of how a lone Doctor overcomes the odds to redeem the Community he so loves; but a Community that is deeply shackled by Witchcraft, and enslaved by the ‘Power’ of a Warlock.',

His Uncle Salim (Ali Mlatso), the only father figure in his life, is helpless in the face of his nephew's ideology. When Salim discovers his new next-door neighbour is actually his long lost childhood friend, Jack (Benson Obiva), he is delighted. But Jack has become a policeman, a job which in a City increasingly divided by religion and tribe and simmering with violence, places a seemingly unbridgeable gulf between them. Yusuf, Jack and Salim's lives become fatally and irrevocably entwined as Salim struggles to hold his friendship, family and community together.",
